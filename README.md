Abstract:

In order to better plan one's college course and eventual career options, it is essential to understand the topics being taught in each course. Every class tries to summarize its goals and outcomes with a course description, as well courses choose textbooks that are likely to meet those expectations. Students will often feel confused about the goal and outcome of a course because a course's description can either be too broad or too narrow for a beginner to comprehend. As a result, a certain percentage of students does not receive enough information to help them understand the course content as well as decide their future career direction. Planning future courses for a student is essential to help them attain their career goals. Unfortunately, assessing raw course information and aligning it to a career without any tools can prove to be difficult. In this paper, we will be applying an automated approach that enables us to find the hidden concepts and meanings within text-based documents, in particular course descriptions, textbook table of contents, summaries, and job listings. We did a comprehensive experiment with the course information from George Mason University (GMU). Our research also involves analysis of prerequisite chains in a GMU program of study. By mining and performing experiments on these datasets, topic modeling can discover the relationship between a course and connect the course to a suitable and desired job. We present our work as a user-facing web-based application (https://github.com/zcai2/topic). This software provides the overview for the book and course topic information as well as a job match feature.
